The Main Stage of Data: A Look into RuPaul's Drag Race 

This project is a data-driven analysis of RuPaul’s reality TV show, RuPaul’s Drag Race.  
The data utilized consists of all queens from seasons 1-14, including their season, competition placement, and home state.
This analysis will do a deep dive into the geographical representation in RuPaul’s Drag Race, as well as the queen's performance based on type or home state. 

 

Methods  

Out of the 34 states represented in seasons 1-14, some states perform better than others.
To visualize this, I created a boxplot that represents the average placement of queens from each state.
For better readability, the box plot is split into 5 separate graphs representing the best and worst states based on their respective queen’s placement in their seasons. 
Queens from Louisiana place highly in the competition, while queens from Arizona have low placements. To further illustrate this, the average placement for every state is calculated.
For example, Louisiana has an average placement of 2.5, while Arizona has an average placement of 9.6. 
A high concentration of queens may affect a state's placement, as the top 6 states besides Louisiana have small concentrations of queens but high placements.
To better visualize the concentration of queens per state, I made a scatter plot listing queens and their placement. 

There are four types of queens in the dataset; comedy, fashion, pageant, and performance.
I illustrated this using a pie chart, where 42.9% of RuPaul’s Drag Race winners were comedy queens and 0% of winners were pageant queens.
To expand on this, I visualized the data in a scatter plot.
The scatter plot revealed that comedy queens outnumber other types of queens, and that a pageant queen has not won between seasons 1 and 14 of RuPaul’s Drag Race.
The concentration of comedy queens may be why there are so many comedy queen winners.  

 

Results 

After analyzing the graphs, comedy queens emerged as the most successful type, claiming 42.9% of all wins across seasons 1-14. 
In contrast, pageant queens did not achieve a single victory. It is likely that this is because there is a high concentration of comedy queens compared to the other types. 
It is also revealed that states with a higher concentration of queens place lower than states with a lower concentration of queens, as shown by the box plots in cells 5 and 6. 
To further illustrate this, the 5 states with the best average placement are Colorado, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, Missouri, and Mississippi. All these states have 2 or less queens in the competition.
